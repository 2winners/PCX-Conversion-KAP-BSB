# PCX-Convertion-KAP-BSB
Tools to convert old PCX charts to new KAP/BSB files


for this we will need a few items 
something that can read/open/run PYTHON script 
KONVERTOR (free tool for windows)
GIMP (is free or other image manipulator)
IMGKAP (free tool to convert image to KAP)
EXEL (for making things simple)

for this project your files will probably look like

NAME.A01
NAME.A02
NAME.B01
NAME.B02
ect 

step 1 :

Open the python script 
Run step 1, follow the instructions in the script

Step 2 : 

Convert the PCX to PNG with KONVERTOR leaving the png in the original folder

Step 3 :
Open the python script 
Run step 3, follow the instructions in the script

step 4 :
Open the created image.png in GIMP
4.1(optional) goto > image > mode > indexed > set colors to 16 to 127 (if you want NIGHT colors for map max 64) but i recomend 16(makes file smaller)
4.2 if done 4.1 file > overwrite image.png

step 5 :
now move the image to the folder IMGKAP is located (if different)

step 6 :
open the EXEL sheet.
